I2CIO aims to create an I2C io expanssion card and the accompanying I2C protocol 
for GPIO and other peripheral expanssion over I2C bus.

We are making an I2C slave board powered by an AVR ATmega32 microcontroller. It 
is controlled by the host computer over an I2C bus. The host may be any computer
desiring GPIO and other low level peripheral control like UART, PWM, SPI, ADC 
etc and possesing an I2C port.

The immediate goal is to establish reliable commpunication between a host 
(beaglebone black in this case) and our AVR board.

Then we aim to frame a protocol in which we can send commands to the AVR.
